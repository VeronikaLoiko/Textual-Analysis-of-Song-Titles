# Textual-Analysis-of-Song-Titles
This project is centered around analyzing song titles from a Spotify dataset to gain insights into their textual characteristics and their potential impact on song popularity. The primary objective is to clean and preprocess the text data, visualize common words, and investigate how specific terms in track names correlate with song popularity.

*  Data Loading and Inspection: The project begins with loading the Spotify dataset into a pandas DataFrame and conducting an initial inspection to understand its structure and contents.

*  Text Preprocessing: Text cleaning techniques are applied to the song titles, removing special characters, digits, and stop words to normalize the text data. Performed additional preprocessing steps like lemmatization to enhance accuracy.

*  Visualization: Created visualizations such as histograms and word clouds to explore common words in song titles.

*  Popularity Analysis: Investigated The relationship between specific words in track names and song popularity. Compare the average popularity of songs containing the word "love"  and without it.
